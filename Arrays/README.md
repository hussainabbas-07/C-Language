# Arrays in C

This folder contains C programs demonstrating the implementation
and usage of arrays in C programming.

The programs cover fundamental to intermediate-level concepts
related to single-dimensional arrays and their practical applications.

## Files Included

### 🔹 array.c
- `Task 1:` – Takes input as a temprature for 7 days into an array and displays.
- `Task 2:` – Find the maximum value of an array.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand how arrays store multiple values in a single variable,
and to apply loop-based logic for processing array elements efficiently.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Array declaration and initialization
- Index-based element access
- Loop traversal of arrays
- Accumulation techniques (sum, average)
- Searching algorithms
- Basic sorting logic

## 📌 Key Learning Outcomes

- Efficient data storage using arrays
- Applying loops with arrays
- Logical problem solving using indexed structures
- Building foundation for advanced topics like
  multidimensional arrays and data structures
