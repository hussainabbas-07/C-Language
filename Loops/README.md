# Loops in C

This folder contains C programs demonstrating different types of loops:

- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do-while` loop
- Nested loops
- Logical and algorithm-based implementations

Each program is written with clean structure, proper documentation,
and beginner-to-intermediate level logic.
